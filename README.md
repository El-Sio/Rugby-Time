Rugby-Time
==========

A prototype Pebble SmartWatch application to display French rugby League (Top 14) data.

Data include :

- Team standings
- Match results
- Best scorers ranking

The API used on the server side is not yet a public one so I can't just commit the PHP source file (but working on it).

This application is written using Pebble SDK 1

This is my first Pebble app and my first time programming in C so thanks in advance for any comments tips to improve the code.
