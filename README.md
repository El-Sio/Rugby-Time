Rugby-Time
==========

A prototype Pebble SmartWatch application to display French rugby League (Top 14) data.

Data include :

- Team standings
- Match results
- Best scorers ranking

The API used on the server side is not yet a public one so I can't just commit the PHP source file (but working on it).

This application is written using Pebble SDK 1

This App Uses HTTPEBBLE by katharine (https://github.com/Katharine/httpebble-watch) and requires the HTTPEBBLE App to be running on your device (https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/httpebble/id650174711?mt=8 for iOS and https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukekorth.httpebble&hl=fr for Android).

This is my first Pebble app and my first time programming in C so thanks in advance for any comments tips to improve the code.
